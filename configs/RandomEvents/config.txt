	"Cache Type"	"0"
		//Types:
		//0 : Wont play any of the round until there are X (cache amount) left in the queue, then it will reset the cache
		//1 : Wont play any rounds in the cache until X (cache amount) is hit, then it will remove the oldest one.
		//2 : Same as 0, but will start removing the oldest one in the queue first.
		
		//Type 2: this means that the 'amount' set will be the random pick set.

						//	will ignore the cache all together.
